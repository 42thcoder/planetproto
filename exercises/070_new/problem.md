Our own 'new'
------------

At this stage we know enough to do amazing things with JavaScript objects.

Challenge
---------

- Define an object called 'machine'
- Define a method called new in machine
- When machine.new is called is should return a new object with the prototype set to machine e.g.

```js
var robot = machine.new();
// machine should be the prototype of robot
```

A file 070.js with the necessary boilerplate has been created for you.
