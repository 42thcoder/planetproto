Our own 'new'
------------

At this stage we know enough to do amazing things with JavaScript objects.

Challenge
---------

- Define an object called 'machine'
- Define a method called new in machine
- When machine.new is called is should return a new object with the prototype set to machine e.g.

```js
var robot = machine.new();
// machine should be the prototype of robot
```

Boilerplate
-----------
```js
... you code here ...

module.exports = {
	machine:  machine
}
```
