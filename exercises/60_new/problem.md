Our own 'new'
------------

At this stage we know enough to do amazing things with JavaScript objects.

Challenge
---------

Write a program that:
- Defines an object called 'Animal'
- Animal should have a method called new
- When new is called is should return a new object with the prototype set to animal e.g.

```js
	var cat = Animal.new();
	// Animal should be the prototype of cat
```
