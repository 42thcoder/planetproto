Challenge
--------

Write a program that:
- Claims the result of 1 + 1

Boilerplate
-----------

A file 010.js with the necessary boilerplate has been created for you.

Hints
-----

To make Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and start writing JavaScript! Exefriendly your program by running it with the node command. e.g.:

$ node program.js
You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

console.log("text");

Sometime the challenge will ask you to make a claim. We have provided claim as a global function.
To make a claim write `claim(actual, expected)`, e.g.:

```js
claim(1 === 1, true);
```

When you are done, you must run:

$ {appname} verify program.js
to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
