Our own 'new'
------------

At this stage we know enough to do amazing things with JavaScript objects.

Challenge
---------

- Define an object called 'robot'
- Define a method called 'new' in robot
- When robot.new is called is should return a new object with the prototype set to robot e.g.

```js
var robby = robot.new();
// robot should be the prototype of robby
```
