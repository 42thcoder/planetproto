Our own 'new'
------------

At this stage we know enough to do amazing things with JavaScript objects.

Challenge
---------

Write a program that:
- Defines an object called 'animal'
- Defines a method called new in animal
- When animal.new is called is should return a new object with the prototype set to animal e.g.

```js
	var cat = animal.new();
	// animal should be the prototype of cat
```

Boilerplate
-----------
```js
... you code here ...

module.exports = {
	animal:  animal
}
```
