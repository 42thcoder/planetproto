Simple objects
=============

There are many way of creating objects in JavaScript, but the simplest way is by using object literals:

```js
var alien = {
	legs: 3
};
```

Challenge
--------

Write a program that:

- Create an object called 'robot' using an object literal
- robot should have a property 'smart'
- Claim the result robot.smart

Boilerplate
-----------

A file 010.js with the necessary boilerplate has been created for you.

Hints
-----

To make Node.js program, create a new file with a .js extension and start writing JavaScript! Exefriendly your program by running it with the node command. e.g.:

$ node program.js
You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

console.log("text");

Sometime the challenge will ask you to make a claim. We have provided claim as a global function.
To make a claim write `claim(actual, expected)`, e.g.:

```js
claim(1 === 1, true);
```

When you are done, you must run:

$ {appname} verify program.js
to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
